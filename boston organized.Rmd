This document is to study the possible relationship between COVID-19 and frequency of crime committed in the city of Boston.

# COVID 19

## Load COVID 19 data for Massachusetts
```{r covid 19 for MA}
# extract MA data from US data. level 3 is by cities but cannot find Boston.
covid19_MA <- covid19("USA", level = 2) %>%
  filter(administrative_area_level_2 == "Massachusetts") %>%
  # filter out days when confirmed is zero or one
  # becasue when it was 1 for a very long time
  filter(confirmed > 1)

# brief display
head(covid19_MA)
```
### Choice explained

#### Scope of data

The covid 19 data related to the whole state of Massachusetts are chosen, because the auther believes that suburban area and capital city are closely related in the context of disease and crime. It is well known that in America most of the residential area, suburban or rual area, is separately identifiable from commercial zone, the cities. While the crime might have happened in the city of Boston, the suspects or victims might live outside of Boston.

#### Confirmed cases instead of Death count

Although the number of confirmed cases can largely be influenced by the testing policy of the local government, the psychological effects of seeing confirmed cases alone might be enough to have some psychological relationship with committing crimes, which is what the author would like to explore.

## Overview of the data
### Visualization
```{r overview of covid, message=FALSE}
# plot cumulative cases
# extract for transforming into time series data
ts_MA <- covid19_MA %>% 
  dplyr::select(date, confirmed) %>%
  ts_xts()

plot.xts(ts_MA,
         main = "Cumulative confirmed cases 
         of COVID19 in Boston")

# plot daily cases
# first difference
ts_diff_MA <- diff(ts_MA)
plot.xts(ts_diff_MA,
         main = "Daily confirmed cases of
         COVID19 in Boston")
```

As shown above, cumulative cases and daily cases have been plotted above.

### Model the infection
#### Construct the model
```{r GAMM model for covid}
# construct GAMM model from prof. Brown's work

# construct data frame of difference, not time series
covid19_MA_diff <- data.frame(diff(covid19_MA$confirmed))
colnames(covid19_MA_diff)[1] = "confirmed"
covid19_MA_diff$date = covid19_MA$date[2:length(covid19_MA$date)]

# time as integer
covid19_MA_diff$timeInt = as.numeric(covid19_MA_diff$date)
# make a copy to avoid perfect collinearity for mixed effect
covid19_MA_diff$timeIid = covid19_MA_diff$timeInt

# GAMM model
gamMA <- gamm4::gamm4(confirmed ~ s(timeInt, k = 85), 
                      random = ~(1|timeIid),
                      data = covid19_MA_diff,
                      family = poisson(link = 'log'))
# currently 70 is the max due to length of data
```

In order to study covid19's impact on Boston, its trend needs to be modeled first to have a better understanding of the situation. A Generalized Additive Mixed Model is used here, which is a direct copy from prof. Patrick Brown's work in STA303 Assignment 3.

#### Visuzalization of the model
```{r plot GAMM}
# plot fitted value
toPredict = data.frame(time = seq(covid19_MA_diff$date[1], 
                                          covid19_MA_diff$date[length(covid19_MA_diff$date)],
                                  by = '1 day'))
toPredict$timeInt = as.numeric(toPredict$time)

# plot

matplot(toPredict$time, 
        exp(do.call(cbind, mgcv::predict.gam(gamMA$gam, toPredict, se.fit=TRUE)) %*% 
              Pmisc::ciMat()), 
        col='red', lty=c(1,2,2), type='l', xaxt='n', xlab='', ylab='Daliy Confirmed cases', 
        ylim = c(0.5, 3500), xlim = as.Date(c(covid19_MA$date[1], covid19_MA$date[length(covid19_MA$date)])))
title("Daily confirmed cases of COVID 19 in Boston")

matpoints(toPredict$time, covid19_MA_diff$confirmed, 
          col = 'black',
          type = 'l')
```
The overall trend of the covid 19 infection in Boston is successfully modeled and displayed above, including a 95% confidence interval. However, those are not very important. Now let's take a look at crime situation in Boston.

#### Obtain the residuals
```{r covid 19 residual}
# obtain forecast
forecast_covid <- data.frame(exp(do.call(cbind, mgcv::predict.gam(gamMA$gam, toPredict, se.fit=TRUE))))
                        
                        
# access residuals
MA_res <- data.frame(covid19_MA_diff$confirmed - forecast_covid$fit)

# transform into time series
MA_res$time = covid19_MA_diff$date
colnames(MA_res)[1] = "residuals"

col_order <- c("time", "residuals")
MA_res <- MA_res[, col_order]

MA_res_ts <- ts_xts(MA_res)

plot.xts(MA_res_ts,
         main = "Daily fluctuation of COVID 19 confirmd cases
         in MA outside its overall trend")
# adf test
adf.test(as.ts(MA_res_ts))

# lag residuals by 4 days due to testing time
MA_res_lag <- stats::lag(MA_res_ts, k = -4)
```

The residuals obtained here represents the fluctuation of daily confirmed cases of COVID 19 in Massachusetts, in order to obtain a stationary time series for future analysis. This residuals can otherwise be interpreted as "fluctuation outside the new norm".

# Boston Crime
## Load crime data
```{r load crime data}
boston <- read.csv("https://data.boston.gov/dataset/6220d948-eae2-4e4b-8723-2dc8e67722a3/resource/12cb3883-56f5-47de-afa5-3b1cf61b257b/download/tmpqy9o_jgd.csv")
head(boston)



# add date
boston <- boston %>%
  mutate(date = substr(OCCURRED_ON_DATE, start = 1, stop = 10)) %>%
  mutate(y_month = substr(OCCURRED_ON_DATE, start = 1, stop = 7))

```

## Overview of crime situation
```{r summary}
boston$YEAR = as.character(boston$YEAR)
boston$MONTH = substr(boston$date, start = 6, stop = 7)

# summary of all crime

```

Many plots in different style about the top 5 most frequent crime in Boston.

## VAR for top 5 crime
### Step1 : Extract cases
```{r extract cases}
# extract top 5 crime
top5crime <- boston %>%
  filter(OFFENSE_DESCRIPTION %in% head(boston_summary$OFFENSE_DESCRIPTION, 5)) %>%
  group_by(date, OFFENSE_DESCRIPTION) %>%
  tally() %>%
  spread(OFFENSE_DESCRIPTION, n)

# rename columns
colnames(top5crime) <- c("time",
                         "investigate",
                         "property damage",
                         "medical",
                         "vandalism",
                         "dispute")

# create date
top5crime$time <- as.Date(top5crime$time,
                          format = "%Y-%m-%d")
# create time series
top5crime_xts <- ts_xts(top5crime[,1:2])

for (i in (3:ncol(top5crime))){
  temp_xts <- ts_xts(top5crime[, c(1,i)])
  top5crime_xts <- merge(top5crime_xts, temp_xts)
}

# extract difference, change per day
top5crime_diff <- na.omit(diff(top5crime_xts))
```
### Step 2: Construct combined time series
```{r top 5 crime VAR}
# specify common time range
# start from when covid was a thing
# end with crime since it is manually updated
common_time <- seq.Date(start(MA_res_ts), as.Date("2020-05-25"), by = "day")

# combine time series of crime and covid
combined_diff <- merge(top5crime_diff[paste(common_time[1],
                                            common_time[length(common_time)],
                                            sep = "/")],
                       MA_res_ts[paste(common_time[1],
                                            common_time[length(common_time)],
                                            sep = "/")])

```
### Step 3: Plot each crime with covid
```{r plot together}
for (i in 1:(ncol(combined_diff) - 1)){
  plotrix::twoord.plot(common_time,
                       combined_diff[,i],
                       common_time,
                       combined_diff$residuals,
                       type = c("l","l"),
                       xaxt = "n",
                       rylab = "number of daily fluctuation of covid 19 cases",
                       ylab = paste("daily change in", colnames(combined_diff)[i]))
                       
}
```

Many look very promising

### Step 5: Construct VAR model
```{r construct var}
# variable selection based on AIC
optimal_investigate <- VARselect(combined_diff[,c(1,6)], type = 'none', lag.max = 10)
optimal_damage <- VARselect(combined_diff[,c(2,6)], type = 'none', lag.max = 10)
optimal_medical <- VARselect(combined_diff[,c(3,6)], type = 'none', lag.max = 10)
optimal_vandalism <- VARselect(combined_diff[,c(4,6)], type = 'none', lag.max = 10)
optimal_dispute <- VARselect(combined_diff[,c(5,6)], type = 'none', lag.max = 10)

# construct the model based on smallest AIC
VAR_investigate <- VAR(y=as.ts(combined_diff[,c(1,6)]), p=optimal_investigate$selection[1])
VAR_damage <- VAR(y=as.ts(combined_diff[,c(2,6)]), p=optimal_damage$selection[1])
VAR_medical <- VAR(y=as.ts(combined_diff[,c(3,6)]), p=optimal_medical$selection[1])
VAR_vandalism <- VAR(y=as.ts(combined_diff[,c(4,6)]), p=optimal_vandalism$selection[1])
VAR_dispute <- VAR(y=as.ts(combined_diff[,c(5,6)]), p=optimal_dispute$selection[1])
```


### Step 6: Granger Causality test
#### Investigate Person
```{r granger investigate}
# investigate person
causality(VAR_investigate, cause = colnames(combined_diff)[1])
causality(VAR_investigate, cause = "residuals")
```
Nothing significant

#### Property damange
```{r granger property}
# property damage
causality(VAR_damage, cause = colnames(combined_diff)[2])
causality(VAR_damage, cause = "residuals")
```
Nothing significant

#### Medical attention
```{r granger medical}
# medical
causality(VAR_medical, cause = colnames(combined_diff)[3])
causality(VAR_medical, cause = "residuals")
```
Medical attention weakly significant both ways.

#### Vandalism
```{r granger vandalism}
# vandalism
causality(VAR_vandalism, cause = colnames(combined_diff)[4])
causality(VAR_vandalism, cause = "residuals")
```
Vandalism significant to covid.

#### Verbal dispute
```{r granger dispute}
# dispute
causality(VAR_dispute, cause = colnames(combined_diff)[5])
causality(VAR_dispute, cause = "residuals")

```

covid significant to verbal dispute.

### Step 7: Impulse Response Function

Only vandalism (from crime), and verbal dispute (from covid) are selected.

```{r irf}
lags = c(1:25)

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
# vandalism
# from crime
irf_vandalism_1 <- irf(VAR_vandalism,
                     impulse = "vandalism",
                     response = "residuals",
                     n.ahead = 24)
plot(irf_vandalism_1)

# ggplot version
irf_vandalism_1_gg <- data.frame(irf_vandalism_1$irf$vandalism[,1],
                                 irf_vandalism_1$Lower$vandalism[,1],
                                 irf_vandalism_1$Upper$vandalism[,1])

colnames(irf_vandalism_1_gg) <- c("mean", "lower", "upper")

i1 <- ggplot(irf_vandalism_1_gg, aes(x = lags)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = mean), color = "black") +

irf_dispute_2 <- irf(VAR_dispute, 
                         impulse = "residuals", 
                         response = "dispute", 
                         n.ahead = 24)
plot(irf_dispute_2)

# ggplot version
irf_dispute_2_gg <- data.frame(irf_dispute_2$irf$residuals[,1],
                               irf_dispute_2$Lower$residuals[,1],
                               irf_dispute_2$Upper$residuals[,1])

colnames(irf_dispute_2_gg) <- c("mean", "lower", "upper")

i2 <- ggplot(irf_dispute_2_gg, aes(x=lags)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = mean), color = "black") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "blue") +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), fill = "lightblue", alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_classic() +
  ggtitle("How many more verbal dispute cases per day there will be 
          after 1 confirmed covid19 case") +
  xlab("Number of days after a confimed covid 19 case")+
  ylab("Number of verbal dispute cases")

ggplotly(i2)
```

### Step 8: Forecast
```{r custom function}
interval_value_formatter <- "function(num, opts, seriesName, g, row, col) {
  value = g.getValue(row, col);
  if(value[0] != value[2]) {
    lower = Dygraph.numberValueFormatter(value[0], opts);
    upper = Dygraph.numberValueFormatter(value[2], opts);
    return '[' + lower + ', ' + upper + ']';
  } else {

### CONCLUSION
Significant contribution on prediction:
  Investigate person (week), verbal dispute

Significant simultaneous movement:
  Vandalism

## Verbal Dispute
### Summary with Visualization
```{r verbal dispute summary}
# extract verbal dispute cases
dispute <- boston %>%
  filter(OFFENSE_DESCRIPTION == "VERBAL DISPUTE") %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(daily_freq = n())

dispute_monthly <- boston %>%
  # exclude May due to incomplete data
  filter(OFFENSE_DESCRIPTION == "VERBAL DISPUTE",
         y_month != "2020-05") %>%
  group_by(y_month) %>%
  summarise(monthly_freq = n())

# change colname name for time series
colnames(dispute)[1] <- "time"
colnames(dispute_monthly)[1] <- "time"

# convert to xts time series
dispute_xts <- ts_xts(dispute)
dispute_monthly_xts <- ts_xts(dispute_monthly)

# plot overall monthly situation
plot.xts(dispute_monthly_xts,
         main = "Number of VERBAL DISPUTE cases 
         per month in Boston")

# plot daily situation since 2020
plot.xts(dispute_xts["2020-01-01/"], 
         main = "number of VERBAL DISPUTE cases 
         per day in Boston since 2020")

# year to year comparison
boston %>%
  filter(OFFENSE_DESCRIPTION == "VERBAL DISPUTE",
         # filter out May 2020
         y_month != "2020-05") %>%
  count(YEAR, MONTH) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(MONTH), y = n, group = YEAR, color = as_factor(YEAR))) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Year to Year comparison of 
          daily verbal dispute frequency in Boston") +
  theme_classic()
```

### Stationarity check
```{r check stationarity and transform}
adf.test(as.ts(dispute_xts))

dispute_diff_xts <- na.omit(diff(dispute_xts))

adf.test(as.ts(dispute_diff_xts))

plot.xts(dispute_diff_xts["2020-01-01/"],
         main = "The change in daily cases of
         VERBAL DISPUTE in Boston")

# since only the section after COVID 19 is related
dispute_diff_xts <- dispute_diff_xts[paste(start(MA_res_ts),end(dispute_diff_xts), sep = "/")]
```

Raw data is not completely stationary in every AR(p) term but would be fine for most of the situation, but with a simple tranformation with its first difference, it rejects random walk null hypothesis and can be stationary in every AR(p) term, which improves our model flexibility, so the first difference would be used.

### Univariate Model
#### Simple AR model
```{r univariate model}
# plot ACF and PACF
acf(as.ts(dispute_diff_xts))
pacf(as.ts(dispute_diff_xts))

# k = 3 for PACF
dispute_ar <- arima(as.ts(dispute_diff_xts), order = c(3,0,0))
dispute_ar

# p = 10 for comparison against VAR
dispute_ar_10 <- arima(as.ts(dispute_diff_xts), order = c(10,0,0))
dispute_ar_10

# auto arima model
dispute_ar_auto <- forecast::auto.arima(as.ts(dispute_diff_xts))
dispute_ar_auto

# artificial neural network model
dispute_ann <- nnetar(as.ts(dispute_diff_xts), size = 10)
dispute_ann
```
Three univariate models have been constructed, which include:

An AR(3) model based on the PACF plot.

An AR(3) model based on the auto.arima algorithm.

An artificial neural network that has 10 hidden nodes and has the form of a AR(3) and S-AR(10) on daily frequency.

```{r in sample performance check}
accu_ar <- accuracy(dispute_ar)
accu_auto <- accuracy(dispute_ar_auto)
accu_ann <- accuracy(dispute_ann)
accu_ar10 <- accuracy(dispute_ar_10)

accu_compare <- data.frame(rbind(accu_ar,
                                 accu_auto,
                                 accu_ann,
                                 accu_ar10))

rownames(accu_compare) <- c("AR(3)", "Auto ARIMA", "Neural Net","AR(10)")

kableExtra::kable(accu_compare, format = "markdown")
```

Looks like artificial neural network is the best performing one out of all categories, with the smallest in-sample error.

```{r univariate forecast}
ar_forecast <- predict(dispute_ar, n.ahead = 24)
auto_forecast <- predict(dispute_ar_auto, n.ahead = 24)
ann_forecast <- predict(dispute_ann, h=24)
dispute_ar_10_forecast <- predict(dispute_ar, n.ahead = 24)

# plot forecast
ts.plot(as.ts(dispute_diff_xts), ar_forecast$pred, 
        auto_forecast$pred, ann_forecast$mean,
        dispute_ar_10_forecast$pred,
        gpars = list(col = c("black", "red","green","blue","purple")))

```

The forecast have been plotted above. All are very short memory, and couldn't predict the fluctuation well in long term.

### Vector Auto-Regressive
```{r overlap 2 time series}
# combine 2 time series
combined_diff <- merge(dispute_diff_xts[paste(start(MA_res_ts),end(dispute_diff_xts), sep = "/")],
                  MA_res_ts[paste(start(MA_res_ts),end(dispute_diff_xts), sep = "/")])

# range where covid and crime overlaps
common_time <- seq.Date(as.Date(start(combined_diff)),
                          as.Date(end(combined_diff)), 
                          by="day")

# examine two time series
plotrix::twoord.plot(common_time, combined_diff$daily_freq,
                     common_time, combined_diff$residuals,
                     type = c("l","l"),
                     main = "Daily number of verbal dispute cases 
                     and number of confirmed cases daily in Boston",
                     xaxt = "n",
                     ylab = "number of verbal dispute cases",
                     rylab = "number of daily fluctuation of covid 19 cases")
```
Possible for VAR

```{r VAR}
# VAR model estimation
VAR_dispute <- vars::VAR(y=as.ts(na.omit(combined_diff)), p = 10)

# Granger Causality test
summary(VAR_dispute)
causality(VAR_dispute, cause = "daily_freq")
causality(VAR_dispute, cause = "residuals")
# prediction advantage from covid to dispute is highly significant

# Impulse Response Function
irf1 <- irf(VAR_dispute, impulse = "daily_freq", response = "residuals", n.ahead = 24)
plot(irf1, sub = "")

irf2 <- irf(VAR_dispute, impulse = "residuals", response = "daily_freq", n.ahead = 24)
plot(irf2, sub = "")

# shock both significant at around 7 days later

# obtain forecast
VAR_dispute_forecast <- predict(VAR_dispute, n.ahead = 24)
par(mai = c(0.4,0.4,0.5,0.1), cex.main = 0.8)
plot(VAR_dispute_forecast)

forecast(VAR_dispute) %>%
  autoplot()

```


## Vandalism
### Summary with Visualization
```{r vandalism summary}
# extract vandalism cases
vandalism <- boston %>%
  filter(OFFENSE_DESCRIPTION == "VANDALISM") %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(daily_freq = n())

vandalism_monthly <- boston %>%
  # exclude May due to incomplete data
  filter(OFFENSE_DESCRIPTION == "VANDALISM",
         y_month != "2020-05") %>%
  group_by(y_month) %>%
  summarise(monthly_freq = n())

# change colname for time series
colnames(vandalism)[1] <- "time"
colnames(vandalism_monthly)[1] <- "time"

# convert to xts time series
vandalism_xts <- ts_xts(vandalism)
vandalism_monthly_xts <- ts_xts(vandalism_monthly)

# plot overall monthly situation
plot.xts(vandalism_monthly_xts,
         main = "Number of VANDALISM cases 
         per month in Boston")

# plot daily situation since 2020
plot.xts(vandalism_xts["2020-01-01/"], 
         main = "number of VANDALISM cases 
         per day in Boston since 2020")

# year to year comparison
boston %>%
  filter(OFFENSE_DESCRIPTION == "VANDALISM",
         # filter out May 2020
         y_month != "2020-05") %>%
  count(YEAR, MONTH) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(MONTH), y = n, group = YEAR, color = as_factor(YEAR))) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Year to Year comparison of 
          daily VANDALISM frequency in Boston") +
  theme_classic()
```

Unusual spikes in March.

### Stationarity check
```{r vandalism stationarity check}
adf.test(as.ts(vandalism_xts))

vandalism_diff_xts <- na.omit(diff(vandalism_xts))

adf.test(as.ts(vandalism_diff_xts))

plot.xts(vandalism_diff_xts["2020-01-01/"],
         main = "The change in daily cases of
         VANDALISM in Boston")

# since only the section after COVID 19 is related
vandalism_diff_xts <- vandalism_diff_xts[paste(start(MA_res_ts),end(vandalism_diff_xts), sep = "/")]
```

Unsual spikes in March.

### Vector Auto Regressive
#### synced covid
```{r overlap 2 time series}
# combine 2 time series
combined_vandalism_diff <- merge(vandalism_diff_xts[paste(start(MA_res_ts),end(vandalism_diff_xts), sep = "/")],
                  MA_res_ts[paste(start(MA_res_ts),end(vandalism_diff_xts), sep = "/")])

# range where covid and crime overlaps
common_time <- seq.Date(as.Date(start(combined_vandalism_diff)),
                          as.Date(end(combined_vandalism_diff)), 
                          by="day")

# examine two time series
plotrix::twoord.plot(common_time, combined_vandalism_diff$daily_freq,
                     common_time, combined_vandalism_diff$residuals,
                     type = c("l","l"),
                     main = "Daily number of vandalism cases 
                     and number of confirmed cases daily in Boston",
                     xaxt = "n",
                     ylab = "number of vandalism cases",
                     rylab = "number of daily fluctuation of covid 19 cases")
```
Almost perfect sync.

VEC is probably not appropriate due to not having long-term relationship in nature, though linear model has a linear fit.

```{r VAR vandalism}
# VAR model estimation
VAR_vandalism <- vars::VAR(y=as.ts(na.omit(combined_vandalism_diff)), p = 10)

# Granger Causality test
summary(VAR_vandalism)
causality(VAR_vandalism, cause = "daily_freq")
causality(VAR_vandalism, cause = "residuals")

irf_vandalism1 <- irf(VAR_vandalism, impulse = "daily_freq", response = "residuals", n.ahead = 24)
plot(irf_vandalism1, sub = "")

irf_vandalism2 <- irf(VAR_vandalism, impulse = "residuals", response = "daily_freq", n.ahead = 24)
plot(irf_vandalism2, sub = "")

# tidy version of forecast
forecast(VAR_vandalism) %>%
  autoplot()

# obtain forecast
VAR_vandalism_forecast <- predict(VAR_vandalism, n.ahead = 24)
par(mai = c(0.4,0.4,0.5,0.1), cex.main = 0.8)
plot(VAR_vandalism_forecast)

```

Not much aside from proving that instantneous causality exists

### Vector Error Correction
```{r see long term relationship}
combined_vandalism_diff %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=residuals, y = daily_freq)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  geom_point()
```
Just some leverage points. cannot conclude long term linear relationship
